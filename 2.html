<h2>Risotto란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>Risotto from riso meaning "rice" is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy. Saffron was originally used for flavour and its signature yellow colour.
Risotto in Italy is often a first course served before a second course, but risotto alla milanese is often served with ossobuco alla milanese as a one-course meal.</p>
